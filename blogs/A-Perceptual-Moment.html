			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on my way to the railway station with my Mom to catch a train for New Delhi and Dad came along to help us boarding. 
			The road to the station was jammed(surprise surprise!!!) with vehicles constantly honking their horns and I was thinking "damm, 
			when will I get to reach the station". Once we reached the station we had to struggle our way to get to the required platform and I 
			was thinking "damm, when will I get to reach the train". We were almost 40 minutes earlier then the train's arrival time. Waiting for 
			the train for those 40 minutes seemed like ages because the atmosphere was filled with some faint fetid smell and the hot and humid
			temperature was just aggravating the situation, and I thought "damm, when will I get to sit on the train". The train arrived and we spent 
			almost 5-10 minutes(tiring of course!!!) in arranging our luggage and now we were waiting for the train to leave and I was thinking the 
			same "damm, when will the train leave". After around 25 minutes, train moved with a humble jerk and about 10 minutes later I thought "damm,
			when will I ge.......

		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, what the hell did I just did. I've spent the last 1 and a half 
		 hour in utter frustration for no reason at all. I pictured what will I do when I'll reach New Delhi, I would be waiting to return to Ahmedabad. 
		 Well I would be definitely enjoying some of my time but the difference between the time I'll enjoy and the time spend in quibbling about trivial 
		 things would be just too damm high. I'm not a social gauche or a person with a morose personality, I enjoy most or probably all of my time when
		 I have a day out with my friends, while playing my favorite video games, discussing movies with my friends, having a get-together with my relatives 
		 etc. The only problem with such cherishing moments is that they are just so rare and sporadically distributed in our life. Having a day out with 
		 friends is possible hardly twice a month and get-together with relatives at an even lesser frequency. What about rest of the time then? We just
		 spend (more relevantly speaking waste) it longing to get switched from one monotonous routine to another. 
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="col-md-12">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s imagine ourself >65 years old sitting on a couch and having a
		flashback at our life. What would we recall?(or what would we like to recall?) those whining moments when we were complaining about things that
		hardly mattered  or those shining moments where we lived life to our fullest. 
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="col-md-12">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone comes with an undisclosed expiry date unless ofcourse if you posses 
		some mystical gifts making you immortal or if you are playing an important role in some hindi serial(where you are bound to come back even if you die),
		so why not enjoy our life and make it’s every moment count. Please don’t misinterpret me, I’m not saying that we should artificially create those 
		cherished moments by leading an extravagant life, what I mean is live your life by cherishing every situation in it. Ahh… I overstated didn’t I by
		saying cherish “EVERY” moment of the life? It is ofcourse normal human tendency to feel frustration and anger, and if you somehow manage to smile 
		at whatever life throws at you then either you have attained inner peace or you should get yourself checked up by a psychiatrist. So let me rephrase
		“We should ‘TRY’ to cherish every moment of our life”. 
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="col-md-12">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So instead of complaining about the temperature and the smell while waiting 
		at the railway station I could have used that time in cracking jokes with my father because I wouldn’t be seeing him for next 10 days and so I should
		have enjoyed those 40 minutes with him. Instead of waiting aimlessly for the train to reach New Delhi, I could have taught my mom how to use an 
		image editing software on her phone because she just loves taking her pictures or I could have just feast on the view of those amazing long mountain 
		ranges, vast fields and that breeze of fresh air, all these are the things which are not possible to savor in our day to day life. So at the end what 
		I learned is that instead of just aimlessly performing the chores and constantly quibbling about it, why not try to make the best of every moment and 
		enjoy life to its fullest.
